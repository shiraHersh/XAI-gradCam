# Grad-Cam

In this work, we tried to compare the differences between Grad-Cam(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf) and Image-Image Attention.

In order to obtain the visual results, first run train_CNN.py and afterwards run main.py.
The dataset can be downloaded via google_drive_links.txt

Also, the folder name "Questionnaire responses and analysis" contains the following files:
- XAI on computer vision - All.csv  ( 15 reponses of prolific users that have no programming experience whatsoever)
- XAI on computer vision.csv ( 15 reponses of prolific users that have some programming experience )
- XAI_merged.csv ( contcatenation of the above files )
- Response_Analysis.ipynb ( jupyter notebook that loads the above files and print some analysis, uses only three python packages - pandas,numpy and scipy.stats )
